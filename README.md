# AngelionOT Project

Angelion OT is an 8.6 Full Global Open Tibia Server project which seeks to fulfill a niche of having an ACTUAL 100% Global OT Server.

# Our Goal

We seek to deliver a Full Global OT distribution which actually fulfills the gap that exists nowadays.
We always see in EVERY distro that promises a Global Map things like "100% MAP and Quests" and when you download the distro and you take a good look at it you realize IT IS NOT 100%, after a few weeks you start noticing broken or even outright missing spawns, maps areas and quests. Broken NPCs and features, unrealistic NPCs that not pertain to a Global Map and in general features and data that is not consistent with the way 8.6 Tibia was.

# What we are doing

Our work has been mainly around delivering an authentic Tibia 8.6 experience to OT players that miss playing back then.
To accomplish this, we are looking to fix all map errors, all script errors, have all the quests working exactly like real tibia,
all monsters having exactly the same HP, EXP, attacks and loot.

So far we have some 40% of the work done to be completly honest.

# Our Tiny Flaws

Currently in the distro we have 1 NPC, 4 monsters, and approximately 10 differents areas around tibia that pertain to a custom
quest that is completely lore-friendly, yet we strive to work on the distro as hard as we can, and then, when we feel like our work
is nearly done and we are satisfied with what we have accomplished we will outright remove it from the distro but still have it available
elsewhere.

Angelion OT is an 8.6 based OT distribution that looks to deliver an 100% Global Experience.
